## FileWR

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rickvanschalkwijk/FileWR.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/rickvanschalkwijk/FileWR)

FileWR is a simple console program written in ASP.NET Core. 
It generates a file full of random char and numbers after that it sorts the number in one file and the char in another.

It's like the useless box :)
